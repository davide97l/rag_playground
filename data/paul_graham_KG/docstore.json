Worked On\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines \u00e2\u0080\u0094 CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\n\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\n\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.\n\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 1987, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e640c38c-54fe-4139-a3be-46b9d3416891": {"__data__": {"id_": "e640c38c-54fe-4139-a3be-46b9d3416891", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/davideliu/Desktop/projects/llm_testing/data/paul_graham/source_files/source.txt", "file_name": "source.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75085, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "097719e5-491b-461d-8e25-0778a589992f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/davideliu/Desktop/projects/llm_testing/data/paul_graham/source_files/source.txt", "file_name": "source.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75085, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "925d011a0dc23e746749b511a5d6c0d31f1e03c258fb94f665d0903a41393abf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "50872f99-c71b-47a3-8642-a80a6bd4c461", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/davideliu/Desktop/projects/llm_testing/data/paul_graham/source_files/source.txt", "file_name": "source.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75085, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "b2b2acac1a855c34acd3c64ad454e3b2543fe29b58139668787b2be6ec132c28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "90f5348f-8021-4c2c-a619-bc6fb96d8df1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4836b1b7aa41f560d2f59555a6d8616f59f9131feae2649e5d5bb1929cbc729c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I was puzzled by the 1401.

In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn't have put this into words when I was 18.

You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial Intelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.\n\nI applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\n\nI don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax.

I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\n\nI'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design.\n\nToward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall.

The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine.

You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least wasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.

Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky.

Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\n\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers.

I'd seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers.

Art galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy ones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.\n\nThen some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd been generating for galleries.

It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually wanted online stores. [8]\n\nThere were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote.

It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually wanted online stores. [8]\n\nThere were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful.\n\nThere were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.\n\nWe did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example, we did what's now called \"doing things that don't scale,\" although at the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're driven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common of which was building stores for them.

The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were so beautiful too.\n\nThough this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.

I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been entirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.\n\nWhen I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was ground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire.

If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me.

A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\n\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]\n\nWow, I thought, there's an audience.

But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.

O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a book, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to have dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which taught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an office.\n\nOne night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party.

I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders.

I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game.

But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way \u00e2\u0080\u0094 indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked.

I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ.

Any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.\n\nBut if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.\n\n\n\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.", "start_char_idx": 73236, "end_char_idx": 75041, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"097719e5-491b-461d-8e25-0778a589992f": {"node_ids": ["50872f99-c71b-47a3-8642-a80a6bd4c461", "e640c38c-54fe-4139-a3be-46b9d3416891", "90f5348f-8021-4c2c-a619-bc6fb96d8df1", "58a00b2c-8a57-4cd8-90a8-ba09b837b4ba", "cb828b8a-22e2-4f3f-b2a4-e97c24eddb45", "2db547c3-c85f-4316-9d39-c99c2141a1b1", "e84daebd-7e7e-4a21-a263-ab636d7ac894", "b213f5a5-ff66-40cc-9934-5491d5d17e1c", "4b74ed8b-372c-4dc9-9a7d-010b3d7e7c3b", "df846da9-4ce3-42a0-890f-de376f614783", "d0c1bf87-7c0e-4538-af77-0e1a9f367c84", "05b2d81d-f40a-4166-96f7-06cc241a636c", "6e40467f-c7ef-49ae-b036-e4c4334281bd", "dece2a4f-c758-4404-9162-dec3aed79bcd", "fd73c26e-ade7-4cac-b440-0a32580c33e4", "af172aed-08be-4bc1-a433-46926f465434", "4d8a68fe-71b2-4a37-92d0-b4c693d0a662", "75405474-2001-4e0b-815f-575d79edb92c", "767fe450-489a-4919-8dc9-c8cfe613fb18", "58528ce6-193e-4dad-982a-12de1bc2d28f", "e14fe100-2763-4913-9d7b-aad81cf85d10", "7ac16f85-d3d8-4280-b8cb-6bb449d9eeeb", "cf4512fc-730d-473a-ad53-b323f7067bc3", "e50870e0-b820-40dc-a8af-ac71c2e92a68", "ac4ed24e-4133-429c-89b4-9bae24df4130", "68b19bf0-a3e3-4a65-b108-54abed40e43c", "bf7c1824-58e1-417a-8617-cdec5bb1e079", "a4d873c6-4a73-4458-a03d-2af66b14ce32", "02c523e6-a54d-4f1d-89aa-fedf34349fa5", "04c1f912-9e40-4c81-bd06-08bb32d5f41b", "f900a272-2a45-4bc9-acac-7e30c1cb29eb", "0f9b49d3-4e8f-4837-9c1e-96ac090e8e8c", "c368adb2-da4d-4863-82f1-41db602a3876", "afbd5ddb-1b4b-44a3-b0a9-60bb8980cc84", "1eff9d00-0d5f-46c0-833d-ae7abc468ca6", "28f8e177-fb3e-47ef-b862-5c14713f74fa", "efceef3a-b179-4a3c-9e12-aeb409014e9b", "451777a3-836e-46f0-9853-c1fc9c3eccc4", "2fd8e456-f022-4dbd-9856-0c45526bbb43", "f28acdf0-0cbd-4ac0-8607-e0db2d714dfd", "9dc3615e-6cb3-4839-bcee-afa372cea47e", "a4582863-8af9-45b3-8704-6f910c2ec9a5", "c5dc637f-7400-4739-82be-573fe4af9df5", "07796f90-15e5-429c-90a0-27736ff09a7e", "d67eab4c-9ffd-4c5d-920b-b0ea840897e5", "422817a9-99e0-4d3d-a038-9d14efc7a8cb", "3ff7e77b-040f-4f1e-b04b-8dd5dbd6e64f", "3c972b31-7524-4f98-906a-c4822c680d8b", "6fa99f53-9af5-4222-b97c-5c5c1d1506dc", "825406e0-c47d-44f1-8407-9e84625230df", "ffedbaa7-ff2f-4b85-9719-192395ac3320", "838287f0-8280-443b-9352-beebea1afd4c", "7d980a1b-4903-46c4-be4d-57e40c69c706", "db116949-4bbd-43a8-9902-3324cafa1f73", "60500748-a7d4-480b-b05e-29177cca650c", "71d3247c-f768-4ecd-a8a3-0dfe1e85c803", "a5c87d19-5baa-4020-b1d0-2e6a2f6969c0", "b717fa60-36a5-45eb-9e4b-0de774b14f31", "b731fc0f-ae2a-4517-8112-1187e0823900", "7f30e786-8c28-4324-b964-965eb2c37944"], "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/davideliu/Desktop/projects/llm_testing/data/paul_graham/source_files/source.txt", "file_name": "source.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75085, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}}}}
