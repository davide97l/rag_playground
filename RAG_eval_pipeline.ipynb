What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where they\\'d start startups instead? We wouldn\\'t feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn\\'t make much money out of it, we\\'d at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.\\n\\nWe\\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\\'d all have dinner there once a week â\\x80\\x94 on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays â\\x80\\x94 and after dinner we\\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\\n\\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\\'d intended.\\n\\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.'"
